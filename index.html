            <h2>A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>I graduated from Southern Adventist University in 2018 with a B.S. in Business Administration and Finance. After working at an investment bank as an advisor and analyst, I realized I was miserable
            and needed a change. I thought about learning how to code but thought it was too late and was scared to make the change. Four years later, I decided to go all in and sign up for Coding Temple to make a 
            career change. <span style="color:red;">IronJourney</span> is to document my experience and everything I learned from the investment industry and friends I made throughout the years. </p>
            <p>I have zero experience in coding after coming from a world of finance. I have a close friend who recommended me Coding Temple after hearing someone he knew experienced this bootcamp. So far I am enjoying
                learning html and css but python is a little harder to grasp. I hope to learn as much as I can from this bootcamp and start a new career path as software engineer. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I like to do many things, I like playing all sports, going for a long bike ride, camping, going to the beach, playing games and recently got into cooking. I just like trying and learning new things.
